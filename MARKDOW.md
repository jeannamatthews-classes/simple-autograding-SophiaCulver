# Markdown vs (Plain) Text Files

**Plaintext (.txt)**: Contains unformatted text. It does not support styling like bold, italic, inline code, links, images, as seen below.

**Markdown (.md)**: A markdown file allows you to format text with wrappers using special syntax. (As seen below)

- **Bold text** (`**bold**`)
- *Italic text* (`*italic*`)
- `Inline code` (`` `code` ``)
- [Links](https://github.com)
- Images:

Markdown is often used for README files and documentation.

Note: Markdown also supports HTML encoding! And we can use it to do stuff like resize images :)
